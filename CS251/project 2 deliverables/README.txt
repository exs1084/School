execute this program by typing ./sort < [input.txt] on any linux machine terminal
input file should be a plain .txt, consisting of the number of threads to use, followed by the number of elements
to be sorted(a power of 2 is required for correct behavior), and then the integers to sort with whitespace seperating all
arguments.
output will be the sorted data list, and the runtime of the program.
