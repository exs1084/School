Execute this program on any linux machine using "./GEp < input.txt"
input.txt must contain the size N of the array/vector, followed by the elements of matrix A
	starting at the top left and going a column at a time, followed by the vector b,
	all with a single space between each numer. ex: {2 1 1 2 3 3} for a 2x2 matrix
the program will print "parallel3", the vector x, and the time to execute the algorithm to standard output
